# Gradio
This repo is focused on explaining machine learning model deployment using the [gradio](https://gradio.app/) library.

## What is Gradio
Gradio is simply a UI library built with python which helps developers to quickly deploy their code into a web app for demo usage or for testing. you can check out the gradio official website here [gradio](https://gradio.app/)

## Why did I build this
I built this as a resource with code for developers who want to learn about machine learning model deployment using gradio.
Machine Learning deployment is a huge issue which is not usually covered in tutorials and stuff and when ML newbies finally get into the real world they can't make use of their model and this sucks.

Gradio is a really cool tool which can help you in model deployment and this project is to help show you how.

## Who can contribute
Basically anyone who has ever worked with the gradio library and has sufficient experience which he or she like wants to share can contribute to this.
